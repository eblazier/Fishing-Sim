<h2><b><u>Saving:</b></h2>
<p>Due to the fact that JavaScript cannot automatically save files to your device, you will have to <i>manually</i> save each save file to its corresponding file in the "/saves/" folder.</p>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the "Toggle SAVING" button.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to "<code>SAVE:</code>", click what slot you'd like to save to.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Download the file to the "/saves/" folder in your "/Fishing-Sim/" folder, overwriting the save file that is already there.<br>
<br>
<b>Know that once you overwrite a file, it cannot be recovered.</b>
</p>
